We ran into several issues adding code to the branches and combining it with the main branch that the TA's could not help us resolve.
Therefore we used a shared document file in Notion's web page which allowed use to share each porition we all worked on with eachother. 
When all of use were done we were able to put all our seperate codes together and form our rough final which we revised so it functioned properly.
